# 💼 Pranjal Verma — Developer Portfolio

A fast, modern, and mobile-friendly personal portfolio built using the latest **React.js ecosystem**, powered by **Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and animated using **Framer Motion**. It showcases my skills, projects, resume, and contact info—everything a developer needs to highlight their presence online.

## 🤔 Why I Built This

I created this portfolio to showcase my skills as a developer and provide a central hub for my projects and resume. My goal was to build a site that was not only fast and responsive but also demonstrated my proficiency with modern front-end technologies like React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The use of Framer Motion was a deliberate choice to add polished, smooth animations that enhance the user experience and highlight my attention to detail.
